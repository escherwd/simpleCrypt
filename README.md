# simpleCrypt
A super simple encrypter and decrypter for plain text for macOS (10.10+)


__This is just a basic idea in code form. The "encryption" (and I use that word loosely) process goes something like this:__
* User inputs text and codeword
* codeword is made into an integer using unicode html codes
* text is translated letter for letter into their unicode codes
* each unicode letter code is multiplied by the codeword int
* since all the letters in the inputed text are all huge numbers, the largest product is found
* all the other numbers have 0's added to them for padding, I.E all the "encrypted" letters have the same character count
* the consistent character count is added to the front of the result string
* an integer saying how many digits the consistent character count is is added to the front
* the final string of numbers is produced
* that final string of numbers is converted into letters and numbers where possible using a custom 0-51 int to char system
* the final, shortened, string is displayed to user

*Reading that made no sense to me and probably didn't make sense to you but that's fine*

__The "decryption" process goes like this:__
* User inputs text and codeword
* codeword is made into an integer using html codes
* the text is divided into the encrypted letters using the consistent character count
* the letters are divided by the codeword integer to get the unicode html code
* the unicode html codes are made back into letters
* all the letters are added to make a string
* the decrypted string is returned to the user

Issues
------
There are a lot of issues with this software, and it'll probably crash frequently
This is just the first version of a project that took 2 days to make so it's not a big deal

* Sometimes the last letters of the decrypted text are wrong [don't really know why]
* Sometimes encrypted text can be decrypted with several different codewords [will fix in next version]
* If there's an error saving the output as a txt file you won't know [will add an alert in next version]
* No async loading/loading indicator; encrypting/decrypting lots of text will lock UI [will fix in next version]
* Very little (if not none) of the code has notes [will add if requested]
